# 📚 Second Chapter (Team Project)

Second Chapter is a project that gives books a second life, offering readers the opportunity to enjoy stories through books that have retained their relevance. Our goal is to create a place where every work finds a new owner, and every word continues to live.

This project is a fully functional online platform for buying used books.
